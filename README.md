The goals of this website is to allow users to find lego sets based on the genre they are looking for out there on the web instead of
having to search multiple sites, this is the work in progress version of the website and is not 
fully complete with all of the functions, i would like to add links at a later date to allow for users to find the sites more easily

>>>>>>> 5ebe566 (Update LEGO Database pages with styling, hover effects, responsive layout, and fixed catalogue images)

Updated. 11/03/2025

All pages of the LEGO Database website were updated for a consistent LEGO theme using yellow and black colors, standard fonts, and responsive layouts. Hover effects were added to headings and buttons, and navigation buttons were styled and aligned uniformly. The search form on the homepage and the contact form were styled with rounded inputs and buttons, with JavaScript validation to ensure proper input. The info page was formatted with headings and lists for clarity, while the catalogue page had fixed image sizing, responsive grid layout, and hover effects on set cards. All images were placed in an /images folder with updated paths so they display correctly, ensuring the entire site is visually consistent and user-friendly.
